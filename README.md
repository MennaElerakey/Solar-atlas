# Solar Atlas

**Solar Atlas** is an interactive Python program that lets users explore the planets of our Solar System — and Earth’s Moon — through simple console commands.  
It’s designed to practice Python fundamentals like functions, conditionals, loops, and user input, while making learning both fun and scientific.

## 🌞 Overview
The Solar Atlas acts as a digital guide to the Solar System.  
Each planet (and the Moon) has its own data function that prints key facts such as:
- Distance from the Sun (or Earth for the Moon)
- Number of moons
- Surface gravity
- Basic descriptive information

Users can explore as many planets as they want in one session and choose to exit anytime.

## ⚙️ Features
- Includes all 8 major planets and Earth’s Moon.  
- Clear, organized function-based structure.  
- Case-insensitive input (e.g. “mars” or “Mars” both work).  
- Option to continue or exit after each choice.  
- Reinforces Python fundamentals:  
  - Functions  
  - If/Else logic  
  - While loops  
  - String handling
